v1.3.22
TLDR version:
- Media viewer updates.
- mpv updated to the latest available version.
- Apk/report server deprecation.
- Third eye support.
- 4chan captcha solver.

Full version:
- Add icons support for Dvach (Thanks to @rgba0)
- Add global search to archiveofsins (Thanks to @WINT-3R)
- Consume a bunch of unfixable crashes in ReplyInputEditText. Possible fix for text sometimes being longtapped when it's actually tapped (override equals/hashcode of SafeRunnableWrapper and compare the inner Runnable).
- Fix crash when clicking links and current input text is not an instance of Spannable.
- Some adjustments for awaitUntilGloballyLaidOutAndGetSize to fix a crash where it returns Size(0, 0).
- Fix crash when importing multiple files from incoming share request.
- Use the incoming posts to add scrollbar marks instead of using posts from the cache because the incoming posts are already sorted so this fixes the issue where scrollbar marks do not account for the current catalog sort order.
- Force PostCell.fileName textView to always be on the left side even if it contains RTL text.
- Store CloudFlare cookie separate for each site domain. This should fix CloudFlare being overwritten when switching between site domains. For example when posting on 4chan.org and then posting on 4channel.org previously stored cookie (for 4chan.org) would be overwritten with the new one (4channel.org) so the next time you post on 4chan.org you would have to pass the CloudFlare checks again. Also fix not being able to play video through ExoPlayer on 2ch.hk. For some reason it returns 403 status when WebView's user agent is used for the request. Works fine with a custom user agent, though. Very weird.
- Handle WebView crashes during controller_firewall_bypass.xml inflation.
- Open external thread links via the browser when browsing archives.
- Add ability to sort bookmarked threads by thread id (basically by thread creation order or thread creation time since both values are ever increasing).
- Fix crashes when adding more than 1 booru with the same endpoint api. Do not allow adding duplicate boorus.
- Disable media prefetcher for archives (they seem to ban people for using prefetcher).
- Show helpful toast when logging in/out of passcode.
- Add ability to export multiple downloaded threads/thread media at once.
- Upon crash, format app life time and user agent in the main process instead of the new process.
- When download media, if a file with the same name already exists, then check it's size and the md5 checksum before asking the user for duplicate resolution or whatever.

v1.3.21
- Fix ReplyInputEditText not displaying new lines (My bad, sorry).

v1.3.20
- Do not disable the reply button if the amount of attached files exceeds known limits.
- Fix a crash when it's impossible to emit Progress event when uploading reply files to the server.
- Auto-select attached files when attaching multiple files (if possible).
- Auto-select files shared into the app when the app is in foreground (if possible).
- Handle keyboard "done" button in DvachCaptchaLayout.
- Rewrite insertTags() and fix all known tag insertion issues.
- Do not show text labels on BottomNavigationView menus in ThemeController.
- Make yandex captcha bypass more robust.
- Fix crashlog reports being sent as regular reports (Without the "crash" label).
- Update CloudFlare detection patterns.
- Use icons for some 4chan captcha actions instead of text buttons to take less horizontal space.
- Suggest updating WebView to the latest version in case CloudFlare bypass takes more than 15 seconds.
- Fix a crash that happens if webview crashes during initialization.
- Hopefully finally fix "IndexOutOfBoundsException" crash somewhere deep inside of Editor$SuggestionsPopupWindow.updateSuggestions.
- Change checkboxes to radio buttons where only one item can be selected at a time (in all the places that I could find throughout the project).
- Allow using any text in proxy address input, add some additional proxy address checks.

v1.3.19

- Add shortcut buttons for "attach file by url" and "attach file remote search" to the "attach new file" button.
- Fix tag insertion with no selected text would move the cursor at unexpected position.
- Rework some BaseFloatingComposeControllers to inherit from a regular Controller (slightly better navigation).
- Add support for overline/superscript/subscript spans.
- More descriptive names for reply formatting buttons. Fix a bug where we hide the reply formatting buttons when posting.
- SlidingPaneLayoutEx. Handle system navigation gestures.
- Add an option to ignore posting cooldowns on the client side. Longtap the reply button or go to the site settings to change it.
- Always colorize the cursors when on Android 10+ even if colorizeTextSelectionCursors setting is disabled.
- Fix crashes when trying to access uninitialized appRestarter.

v1.3.18
- Fix cloudflare clearance cookie not being remembered due to a race condition.
- Fix 2ch.hk global search.
- Fix slight inaccuracy when auto-solving 4chan captchas (captcha solver apk has been updated).
- Add some text format tags that are supported by 2ch.hk
- Add ability to export only media from downloaded threads.

v1.3.17
- Quickfix not being able to use the captcha solver on Android 11+

v1.3.15
- Fix crashes when post subject only has whitespaces in it.
- Fix silent crash when post comment has ">>0" in it.
- Hopefully fix "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException LazyVerticalGrid's width should be bound by parent." crash.

v1.3.14

v1.3.13
- Fix a bunch of crashes/bugs that were accumulated in the "Reports" repository.

v1.3.12
- New crash reporting system. Crashlogs are not stored on the disk anymore. When a crash happens a separate activity will be shown where you will be able to send the report. ANR detection was completely removed because of too many false positives.

v1.3.11
- Dynamically load board flags/icons. When a new boards adds flag support you need to refresh the whole board list (Sites -> 4chan -> Set up boards -> Refresh).
- Add colorizeTextSelectionCursors setting to disable applying theme colors to text selection cursors. This should hopefully fix weird bugs that happen to text selection cursors when custom colors are applied to them (xiaomi).

v1.3.10
- New site support - vhschan (thanks to MrPurple666).
- Wired-7 improvements (thanks to Wired-7).
- Fix crashes on xiaomi devices when text selection menu shows up.
- Fix ExoPlayer's controls showing up when they shouldn't.
- Do not show postNo/time/etc in the post title when using grid/staggered grid catalog mode.
- Fix rare NPE most likely because of postCellCallback and chanDescriptor not being properly synchronized.
- Consume crashes inside of dispatchKeyEvent() callback.

v1.3.9
- Fix very slow processing of hidden/removed posts in threads when there are very very very deep reply chains (a post could be processed tens of millions of times or even more) due to post processing resulting in very deep recursion.
- Mark "hot" posts with different color on the scrollbar (blue instead if red) to make it distinguishable from (You)s.
- Fix marked posts not being updated when navigating reply chains.
- Fix crash when opening BoardSelectionController when viewing a composite catalog.
- Add View.IMPORTANT_FOR_AUTOFILL_NO_EXCLUDE_DESCENDANTS flag to more views in hope to fix the "TransactionTooLargeException" on samsung devices (there are literally only crashlogs from 1 samsung device).
- Attempt to fix "Resources$NotFoundException: String resource ID #0x7f120303" on some xiaomi devices (Miui 13 or whatever).

v1.3.8
- Use batching in ChanPostLocalSource.getThreadOriginalPostsByDatabaseId().

- Potential fix for weird "android.os.TransactionTooLargeException: data parcel size 296380 bytes" crashes that happen somewhere inside AutofillManager.
- When navigating to a thread via the catalog search do not scroll to the OP but use the last viewed post position.
- Open a board on the current site with the entered board code when clicking keyboard's DONE button in the board selection menu.
- Potential fix for "Bad postCellDataWidthNoPaddings: 0" crash.
- Fix not being able to enter 2ch.hk passcode info.
- Use a different method to recycle posts when navigating reply chains which shouldn't have this weird glitch where the reply list is shown empty for a split second and then expanded with posts.
- Other minor changes and fixes.

v1.3.6
- Fix, suppress or add logs for a bunch of crashes accumulated over the past days.

v1.3.5
- Hide/remove post logic rewritten from scratch. Removed posts are no longer shown in the "X replies" post text view. Both hidden and removed posts are nor marked as hidden/removed in the "X replies" post text view. Quotes pointing to hidden/removed posts are now marked as hidden/removed accordingly. Clicking such quotes will first unhide/unremove the post and then after clicking it again the post will be shown (works in reply chains as well). 
More info regarding the changes can be found here: https://github.com/K1rakishou/Kuroba-Experimental/wiki/Post-filtering-changes-in-v1.3.5
- Fix crash when trying to select more than 1000 threads (sqlite limits).
- Fix ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when setting spans.
- Manually hidden/removed threads can now be viewed and restored by going to three dot menu in the catalog -> "View manually hidden/removed threads".
- Fix memory leak when walking through post reply chains where posts have images (basically in this case PostImageThumbnailView.unbindPostImage() is never called so we never cancel active coroutines/flow which causes leaks).
- Include postNo into PostCellStub title.

v1.3.4
- Add app run time to the report footer.

v1.3.3
- Fix media viewer action strip blinking for an instant when opening media viewer with controls hidden.
- Add ability to reorder boorus + make BuildBooruSettingItem collapsable.
- Fix play/pause button not working in ExoPlayer/Mpv media views when it's impossible to autoplay the video (no wifi and setting is set to only play when wifi connected, etc.)
- Fix ExoPlayer view not handling video updates (like progress/pause/resume) in some cases.
- Hide postPopupHelper when opening FiltersController.
- ThirdEye can now look for nested or wildcard json keys.
	For example:
	- "test1 > test2 > test3" will search for json value which is inside of 2 json objects (test1 and test2) with name test3.
	- "test1 > test2 > *" will search for similar stuff but the last key may be any string (basically it just always matches it).
- Add headers to ThirdEye network requests.
- Fix not being able to load 420chan boards.
- Change bg color of media viewer UI elements (make it more transparent). Add spacer between the child elements inside of the InsetAwareLinearLayout.

v1.3.2
- Third eye support. Can be found in thread options (Thread -> three dot menu -> More options -> Third eye settings).
- Implement nsfw mode for catalog/thread/album thumbnails. Can be found in thread options (Thread -> three dot menu -> More options -> NSFW mode).
- Hopefully fix some notifications not getting closed when posting.
- Use the left side of the screen for media viewer action strip when on tablets.
- Decrease the minimumTouchTargetSize for Jetpack Compose UI elements.
- Fix the restartApp() method which hasn't been working for months.
- Add ability to leave comment via the built-in reporting system on already existing issues on Github by providing their issueId.

v1.3.1
- Fix crash when opening reply chain from the media viewer where posts have flags.
- Fix memory leak caused by PostTitleTimeUpdate routine.

v1.3.0
- Allow visiting boards that are not currently added into the BoardManager. Basically it's now possible to open boards without having to download the board list from the server. Sites without catalog support won't work, obviously (like warosu).
- Remove ability to create 4chan boards manually (you don't need it anymore, see ^).
- Apk/report server deprecation. It will be shut down in a couple of weeks. All the new Anr/Crash reports will be sent to a separate github repo now. See https://github.com/KurobaExReports/Reports/issues
- Update mpv with all the dependencies. You will have to download the new libraries.
- Fix MpvVideoMediaView reload media button not doing anything.
- Set mediaViewerMaxOffscreenPages to 1 by default instead of 2. This will only be applied to fresh app installs. If you have problems when viewing media such as lags or micro-freezes then it's recommended to set that setting to 1 since it will reduce the amount of media loaded into the memory at once. It can be done in the media viewer settings.
- Move DiskCacheSettings from DeveloperSettingsScreen to CacheSettingsScreen. 
- Add setting to disable in-app "events".
- Improve open thread by url. It can now open catalogs/threads by board code/threadId or full url like before. Also open thread by ID was merged into open catalogs/threads by identifier.
- Animate navigation history list element updates.
- Move media viewer action buttons to bottom of the screen.
- Add ability to display post replies in media viewer without having to close it.
- Prefer using HARDWARE bitmaps when possible (stored only in the GPU memory, only supported on API 26+). Force RGB_565 if the device is low ram device. In all other cases use ARGB_8888.
- Notify the user more aggressively when root directory is not accessible because apparently it's still not obvious to the user what to do in this situation.
- Dot not use the full image url when "High resolution cell" setting is enabled and remove thumbnail spoilers enabled too.
- Fix not being able to download archived 2ch.hk threads.
- Do not crash when an url inside of soundpost tag is incorrect.
- Fix a bug where clicking any kind of bookmark notification would not automatically run the foreground watcher right away after the app is started because by the time BookmarkForegroundWatcher.updateBookmarksWorkerLoop() is called applicationVisibilityManager.isAppInForeground() would still be false (since the activity might not be created yet).
